# measure uncertainty

Some methods to measure the uncertainty in deep neural network.

Mean-Variance Network uses a mean-variance structure based on normal distribution.

Alpha-Beta Network use a alpha-beta structure based on beta(dirichlet) distribution.

Previous work of bootstrap method, split method and dropout method also included in prediction_interval.
